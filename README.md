Programming assignments for course: Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures(https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-graphs-data-structures/home/welcome)

The repository contains complete solutions for course programming assignments for each of four weeks.

Week1: GraphSCCFinder.java implements Kosaraju DFS-based algorithm to find all find the strongly connected components (SCC) in a graph.

Week2: DijkstraShortestPathFinder.java implements Dijkstra shortest path finding algorithm in a graph.

Week3: StreamMedianFinder.java finds the sum of medians in integer streams in which one number is pushed in each of 10000 time steps. 
       One min heap and one max heap are used to solve this "Median Maintenance" problem.

Week4: TwoSumFinder.java implements a fast running algorithm that finds two sums of one million integers. The sum is upper and lower bounded.

For more details, please check the class description of each .java file, or find course resources online.
